notes:

added ct scripts to help solve issues with rune skill cutting, the skill cooldown exploit, and prevent the stealth exploit

added a modification that will remove the code that keeps guards from detecting a character in stealth mode

side note: some of the ct files are combinations of multiple scripts that need to be separated before assembling
