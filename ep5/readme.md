**contents**

* updated version of shen's item mall solution for ep5 servers along with the source code

* ps_game that has been reversed to have no custom dll injections for those that don't want an item mall

* possible solution for capes being enchanted via client modification (likely accompanied by packet injection)

* ct files that help solve issues with rune skill cutting, the skill cooldown exploit, and prevent the stealth exploit

* ct file that will remove the code that keeps guards from detecting a character in stealth mode

* ct file that will prevent the service from crashing if a gm dismounts while invisible (reported by two admins)

**notes** 

* ps_game scripts for ep5 are valid for ep6 because the ep6 ps_game (1556kb) is an edited ep5 ps_game (1549kb)

* some of the ct files are combinations of multiple scripts that need to be separated before assembling
