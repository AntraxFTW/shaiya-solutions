notes:

added a possible solution for capes being enchanted via client modification (likely accompanied by packet injection)

added ct scripts to help solve issues with rune skill cutting, the skill cooldown exploit, and prevent the stealth exploit

added a modification that will remove the code that keeps guards from detecting a character in stealth mode

added a ps_game script that will prevent the service from crashing if a gm dismounts while invisible (reported by two admins)

added an ep5 ps_game that has been reversed to have no custom dll injections for those that don't want an item mall

side notes: 

ps_game scripts for ep5 are valid for ep6 because the ep6 ps_game (1556kb) is an ep5 ps_game (1549kb) with an edited PE header

some of the ct files are combinations of multiple scripts that need to be separated before assembling
