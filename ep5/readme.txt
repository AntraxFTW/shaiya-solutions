all server side scripts for ep5 are valid for ep6, because the ep6 ps_game is an ep5 ps_game with a modified pe header

included a possible solution for capes being enchanted via client hacking

the solution for the stealth exploit was added, but may not be necessary in this epsiode

added a modification that will remove the code that keeps guards from detecting a character in stealth mode

included a ps_game solution that will prevent the service from crashing if a gm dismounts while invisible

added the ep5 version of the rune skill cut solution
