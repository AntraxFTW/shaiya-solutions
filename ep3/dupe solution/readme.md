*disclaimer: this solution has not been tested enough to confirm that it prevents duping on ep3 servers*

**contents**

* ps_dbAgent for ep3 that has been edited to match lilprohacker's ep4 packet-based dupe solution

* stored procedure that has been slightly edited for the bootleggery Y coordinate (credits: lilprohacker)

* stored procedures that need to be added to ps_gamelog.dbo.usp_Insert_Action_Log_E (credits: nubness)

**notes**

* leave status must update properly for the dbo.usp_Insert_Action_Log_E procedures to work
